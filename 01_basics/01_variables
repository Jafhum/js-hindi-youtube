var accName = "jafhum";

// let and const keywords are new ES6 updated keywords where they have only block scope and for the let key word we can re-initialize it but we can't re-declare it
let accPassword= "Jafhum@786";

// let accPassword = "Jafar@786"; //here we are re declaring that why it is showing error but re initilize can be work
